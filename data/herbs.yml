# Some explanation:
# - plants, bushes, and shrubs do not have keywords (so e.g. "get athelas"
#   won't work to pick the plant), but leaves, flowers, petals, etc. will
#   have keywords.
# - to crush a plant, you have to "wield plant" and "crush plant".
# - (2/700) means "weight=2, cost=700". The weight is in tens of grams,
#   so 45 weight units = 1 pound. The cost is in copper pennies.
# - plants, flowers, leaves, petals... can be sold at herbalists; but berries
#   and mushrooms generally cannot. They can be sold at some "general stores"
#   (like, I think, the small shop just east of GH).
