The sombre air extinguishes your light!

You carefully insert the amethyst into the etched recess.
The amethyst briefly glows a fiery red before fading back to normal.
Two shimmering silvery lines begin to form the intricate outline of an arched doorway.
The doors swing silently outward inch by inch until they lay back against the wall.
No sooner have you opened the bronze doors than they begin swinging shut of their own accord.

A dreadful cackling comes from the shadows that twist and swirl around you from every direction.
Suddenly the angle of the shaft becomes too steep for you to remain in control and you are sent tumbling down recklessly.

The cart quickly picks up speed, the wheels making a screeching noise against the iron rails.
Twisting and turning, the cart makes its way further down, faster and faster into the mountain.
Racing at an insane speed, the cart makes a sharp turn, barely staying on the rails.

An old, sturdy mine cart stands here on the end of a pair of iron rails.

You break off a large chunk of earth, and note with satisfaction the widening gap in the wall.
