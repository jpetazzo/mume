The amethyst briefly glows a fiery red before fading back to normal.
Two shimmering silvery lines begin to form the intricate outline of an arched doorway.

Erestor looks in disgust at your cloak.
Erestor utters some strange words, and a mottled cloak crumbles into dust.

The cart quickly picks up speed, the wheels making a screeching noise against the iron rails.
Twisting and turning, the cart makes its way further down, faster and faster into the mountain.
Racing at an insane speed, the cart makes a sharp turn, barely staying on the rails.
The cart crashes into a large cave, detached from the rails. You are hurled out of the cart and end up crashing into a rock wall. All of a sudden the world has come to a halt around you.
An old, sturdy mine cart stands here on the end of a pair of iron rails.

You break off a large chunk of earth, and note with satisfaction the widening gap in the wall.
You give a final, mighty thrust of the pickaxe and break down the last chunk of the wall, but the strain breaks your pickaxe as well.
