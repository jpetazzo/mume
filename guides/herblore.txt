                                   HERBLORES

### Important! You CAN NOT mix herblore if you have not obtained special book/
### etc writing from the certain mob, even if you already know all components
### needed for lore. If you try it, you will always produce "unknown mishmash"
### instead of lore. But even if you have lore in your list (use "herblores"
### command while having herbal kit in equipment), you can fail attempt to make
### lore if you have low WIS. It is why for warrior/thief it's better to give
### lores/components to a friend caster to mix the lore.

  Description:
Poison is often deadly, and requires immediate action.Nature has provided us
with certain herbs to defend ourselves from this vicious danger, if we know how
to use them. Unfortunately, any remedy we hope to make will be very complex. The
simplest, and most effective, is outlined below.

First, a base is made with two handfuls of blackberries, because of their
healthy juice. Water lily petals, to purify the blood, and figwort, to purge the
stomach, make that a thick paste. Finally the healing properties of the
kingsfoil make it really efficient.

This mixture will not only cure most of the poisons that can be find in plants
and water, but as well purge your body from the somewhat annoying effects of any
potions.

draught which gives a limited vision in the night. The base of this concoction
is the brown powder of a cinnamon stalk. In it add a handfull of rosemary leaves,
to make mind more attentive. In this dry mixture put shreds of humidified
phosphorescent moss, and mix carefully the whole, until you get a phosphorescent
liquid. When quaffing it, you will feel more able to perceive your environment,

                                   Arachnia
  Description:
Among the beasts of our lands, the spiders are the most feared, mostly because
they sting their victim and inject a poison which slows their moves and their
brain. Thanks to a careful study of the grey spider anatomia, we have been able
to use the venom sack of this beast to produce a terribly dangerous poison. In a
bowl, crush the tail of a young salamander into a shapeless pulp. Add the fur of
a bat to stabilize the components, and, most important, the fluid sack of a grey
spider. The sack must have been butchered recently from the monster, and kept in
a wet sack during its transport. Mix the three ingredients until a brownish
liquid is obtained.

                                  Belladonna
  Description:
The plants of the wilderness have a large spectrum of applications. Those who
know the use of three natural ingredients can produce a mild poison. Crush
carefully the tongue of a frog in a vial, as base for your concoction. Get a
freshly recolted Belladonna, the plant known for its dangerous properties. Use
the fruits or the leaves of the plant, for it is where its essence is mostly
concentrated. Add then a red mushroom, the sort which gives headache and
dizziness when eaten. Mix the reagents and seal the liquid in a vial. That
draught will weaken your opponent, who will lose an important part of his
skills. It can of course be used to poison your arrows or your blade.

  How to obtain:

a dirty note, that carries the lore of a belladonna poison. Also one brigand
have sometimes such dirty note as well, who is located all east and then south

                                 Drake-slumber
  Description:
This is the recipe of a brew which should be able to debilitate even a very
powerful beast - one which would not succumb to ordinary magic or weaker potions
and poisons.

  The sticky pulp of a fresh milkweed plant will make a ready base for the
draught. All parts of thisplant cause weakness and staggering, then prostration,
laboured breathing and a profound sleep. This should serve to slow and weaken
the creature, despite its strength and size. To the base add some valerian root
and the flowers of the mountain poppy - these herbs act to tranquilise and to
alter the workings of the mind. They also inhibit aggression, which will be most
important in controlling the beast.

  Leaves, flowers and fruit of the hemlock plant will weaken the animal, slowing
its heart and suppressing its breathing. A single fly agaric mushroom is also
needed - the flesh of this bright red fungus is said to bring on dizziness and a
lack of coordination, followed by a deep sleep.

  To complete the brew one white fruit of the baneberry plant is needed. This
strong poison will weaken the creature, and should further assist in bringing
about dizziness and poor flow of the blood.

                                    Hemlock
  Description:
The plants of the wilderness have a large spectrum of applications. Those who
know the use of the herbs can produce a whole set of curing concoctions, and of
deadly mixtures also. This is the formula for one of the worst. Carefully crush
the tongue of an old frog as base of your preparation. Take the leaves, the
stem and the fruits of a hemlock and add them. Add then a handful of inkberries
from Hollin. Mix carefully and seal it in a vial. That draught will weaken all
the abilities of the person drinking it, and can successfully be poured over
your blade to poison your opponents.

                                   Psylonia
  Description:
Anyone who ate the wrong mushroom knows that the effects of mushroom intoxication
can be really surprising. Headache, dizziness, hallucinations are some of the
possible symptoms. Some people, like the inhabitants of the remote land known as
Yuka Taan, south of Harad, use mushrooms as a drug. Others have found a more
warlike usage. The orcs of the east know many preparations based on mushrooms.
One of the most efficient, a poison which does not kill the victims, but drains
them and stop their concentration, is described here.

  The base is made by a handful of inkberries from Hollin. A red mushroom is
crushed with the berries, to thicken the paste. The third ingredient is the most
important: the rare, sickly green, mushroom. It must be added before the
concoction is mixed. Few people have ever found this mushroom: it is rumoured to
grow in humid caves or in the darkest forests of the land.

  How to obtain:
The lore of Psylonia written on a crumpled paper can be found at the goblin
shaman in the Goblins Caves in the northern Misty Mountains. These papers are
VERY rare. In the secret in same caves loads mushroom that needed for this lore.

  Effects:
When smeared on your weapon or to your arrows with the envenom skill you have
the potential to affect your victims with the dreaded Psylonia poison. This
poison does not kill the victims, but stops their manaregen and greately eats
their mana.

  Ingredients:
inkberries, red mushroom and sickly green mushroom.

  Product:
Mildew covered vial.



                                     Venom

wilderness. The following recipe uses the venom sack of the feared rattlesnake.
Make a base with the tail of an adult salamander. Add a freshly butchered bat
fur, to thicken the paste, and the small venom sack of a rattlesnake. The
resulting liquid will kill a cow in a few minutes, and even the strongest
fighter will risk death in a few hours.

  How to obtain:
North from windswept grounds and before Mormaeg's lair lurks a suspicious
Assassin that carries the knowledge of the Venom lore inscribed on a small
plaque made of clay. This plaque is very rare (he have often too dirty note that
