The Magic Users guildmaster is the Black Sorcerer. He either walks btw orc
cave and DT (Dark Tower) or s.w./s of AT (Abandoned Tower).

The cleric master a Dark Robed Man use to walk on Path to Angmar. On map it
is east of R and all zones north.

Thief master Grey Cloaked Man does not teach pierce, attack, missile or
envenom. He patrols the Hills two zones east or R or the path at Lit Cave
three zones south of R (Rocky Path south of open thornbushes, follow path
all south, east, all north). He is the only BN master who is aggressive to
orc players.

The ranger master a Brown Robed Man use to patrol Eregion north zone of
MM on map or the zones n.w/w/ww of MM. You find him if you have good track.
He hides most of the time so you need sense life to follow him. He mends eq.
But you cant give him a receipt back if you dont have sense life. There are
two differnt Brown Robed Man so if you have an old receipt from the wrong
one (only one man load at time) then he does not accept it. The recipts look
a little different one of the masters write the room name on it the other
write Shards of Numenor.

I have given auxiliary info to newbie bn's that some prefer to learn
on their own.  So if you're a diehard bn who wants to suffer even more,
don't read this.

   MAPPING

Some people insist that they need play a bn before they have another
character high level.  This is problematic primarily because the hardest
part of playing a bn is learning how to get somewhere "safe" after
they pray to a random location.  There is no recipe for getting "safe",
as mentioned in other posts, sometimes even legend bn's have trouble
getting "safe" after a pray.  It *IS* possible to learn the geography
as a bn.  It is very difficult, since one can only make small maps
until they die, and then hope after enough deaths they can start fitting
the pieces together (I did this).  Learning invisibility helps alot
when trying to piece maps together, primarily because of wargs.

A tid-bit for those who haven't had much experience at mume, one
MUST understand the "map" command.  Try "help map".  If you have any
trouble with it, playing bn is not for you.  Most grids on the map
consist of areas approximately 10x10 rooms (with small variations).

   GUILDMASTERS

There are four guildmasters, cleric/thief/sorcerer/ranger.  The
difficulty in finding each is in the order I mentioned them, cleric
being easiest and ranger being hardest.  The cleric guildmaster
always loads on the "Path to Angmar" (not to be confused with
"Angmarian Trail").  He never wanders far, so is easy to find.  The
"Path to Angmar" is north of loudwater plains if you follow a trail
northwest (not buinen heath).  The thief guildmaster doesn't wander
far from where he loads, but can load in one of two places: a forest
east of wild forest (2 zones east of R on the map) (be careful of
wolves and bears), or on the trail winding upwards east of abr
(abr = ancient broken road).  Sorcerer guildmaster will wander far
and wide, but generally loads in one of two places: either near
wolfgate by NOC (usually in the mountains just west and south of
wolfgate) (1 zone south and 1 zone west of the O on the map), or
south of ABR in green hills.  The ranger guildmaster used to be
the hardest to find because he sneaks and hides, so lowbie bn's
wont even be able to see him unless they are in the same room.
I think the recent changes to sneak has made it so that he reveals
himself, but it's still a task to find him.  Like the sorcerer he

*** Return: continue, b: back one page, r: redisplay, q:quit (66%) *** [0;35m[0m
will also wander far and wide, but since he regens either near khuzur
or near woodhall (sw of khuzur), it's not too hard to find him if
you xp/map in eregion.

If you see me logged in, and I'm not too busy, you can often get
me to locate the exact zone the sorcerer or ranger is in at the time.
Dont bother me for cleric or thief, I figure that with the above
information, you should learn to find them on your own.

There is no warrior guildmaster, and you cannot learn pierce from
the thief guildmaster.  So if you're a warrior bn, you may wish to
quit now.  People still seem to like playing thief bn's, but they
don't generally go very far.  BN's are primarily mages and some
clerics (you can't learn heal either, and cure serious only to about
50 percent).  Of course, if you want to break the mold... good luck.

   XPING

It's relatively easy to xp a bn to level 4.  Recover a bow and
some arrows (along with other basics), and you'll find that with a
bow, most small animals will fall with just a few shots.  If you
try to take on larger animals you may find all your arrows will
break.  Getting 5th level takes a little more patience, but if you
are playing your first bn, 4th is good enough to get invisability
which will help you learn your way around immensely.

Written on Sun Jun 22 01:11:20 1997

SUMMARY
A- START AND RENT
B- SUPPORTING OTHER RACES
C- NEWBIE AREAS
D- EQUIPMENT
E- PRACTICE AND MEND

- SUMMARY ----------
Learn darkie life as an ORC scout or warrior. Level your orc to 10-12 and
then you have a good MAPPER. As BN the best equipment sorcers are CONTAINERS
like bushes and chests. Don't play a BN who don't have wisdom enough to 
practice BOB. First spells and skills to learn are in order of priority
invisibility, ride, swim, climb, create food and create light. Later you 
decay what you don't need.

A- START AND RENT ----------
Just take what you need from the room east of this board. You will die alot
and if you grab more than you need soon all equipment will be spread over
Arda in your corpses.

Nothing loads in this room. All equipment and food that might bee here are
brought from next room by other players so it can load again in The Crypt.
Food and sacks load visible. You can reveal shortsword, shield, blanket,
dagger, knife, torch, cup, bow, quiver and arrows. It loads in 15 minutes
periods. Newbie kit from Gods (just one) are some silver, food, bow, quiver
and arrows.

When you PRAY just type 'pray'. If you type 'pray east' you are speaking
to the Gods and they hear Yourname prays east. Before you pray hold a torch
no matter time. You might pray into a dark room. If any higher level player
is here ask her/him to invis you. If you pray to a place where the only exits
are swim you use pray to speak to the Gods who will help you out.

RENT is free. You only need money to mend. You can only camp rent in a room
which is not rocky, road, water, indoor or city. When you rent remove torch
and type 'camp rent'.

B- SUPPORTING OTHER RACES ----------
If we support other races they support us. Narrate (troll does not hear orc
player who is not grouped), group orc and trolls, enchant, summon wargs, bob,
strength, cure critic and darkness are some examples.

We are the only race who dont't a troll player as *a Troll* and orc as

*** Return: continue, b: back one page, r: redisplay, q:quit (37%) *** [0;35m[0m
*an Orc*. When we group orc and trolls they see each other normally and
they can be heard to all darkie players when they narrate. 

If a player tells you to narrate a message just do it, do not question or
ask why. Then tell the player 'done' so he/she knows his/her message to you
was not lost in some spam. 

C- NEWBIE AREAS ----------
You will find them if you some mapping. Map wherever you pray but first learn
darkie life as an orc player. Make maps/memorize dont depend on other players
to lead you to tp or kills. When your orc warrior/scout is about level 11 you
have a good mapper. 

Remember game save of your carachter is only a few days as level 1-5. From
level 6 game save is about 5 times your level rl (real life) days. If you
run for tp after you got stats, die alot, lose some levels, then you can not
wait to long to log in next time.

We are not welcome in ORC CAVE. Entrance to Mines and rooms south of it is
not orc cave. Three elite guards blocks your way in the room north of
Entrance to Mines. An orc assassin sometimes sneak and kill you in one 
backstab in this area.

REDHORN CAVE welcomes us except the rent dude and some creatures who are
aggressive to all players.

E- EQUIPMENT ----------
The main sorces are containers, whitie players, mobs, tall orc players and
some rooms in Warrens where players use to hide eq.

Containers are bush, corpse, table, rocks, stone, fireplace, alcove and
chest. When you pass one examine it, not just the first time you pass, 
someone else might have lootet it already. Some eq loads on ground and
are picked up by mobs. So if examine corpse if its first kill.

Eq that load in a container is UNISIZE. It will fit the first player who
use it e.g. you or a troll player you might give boots to. 

Mobs whos eq we can use, not all times, are hunter, elven hunter, Eoghha
and brigand.


E- PRACTICE AND MEND ----------
The masters are wandering around. There are no warrior master which is good.
We are supposed to have penalties and this one gives us more pracs to spend
on spells. 

*** Return: continue, b: back one page, r: redisplay, q:quit (73%) *** [0;35m[0m

The Magic Users guildmaster is the Black Sorcerer. He either walks btw orc
cave and DT (Dark Tower) or s.w./s of AT (Abandoned Tower).

The cleric master a Dark Robed Man use to walk on Path to Angmar. On map it
is east of R and all zones north.

Thief master Grey Cloaked Man does not teach pierce, attack, missile or
envenom. He patrols the Hills two zones east or R or the path at Lit Cave
three zones south of R (Rocky Path south of open thornbushes, follow path
all south, east, all north). He is the only BN master who is aggressive to
orc players.

The ranger master a Brown Robed Man use to patrol Eregion north zone of
MM on map or the zones n.w/w/ww of MM. You find him if you have good track.
He hides most of the time so you need sense life to follow him. He mends eq.
But you cant give him a receipt back if you dont have sense life. There are
two differnt Brown Robed Man so if you have an old receipt from the wrong
one (only one man load at time) then he does not accept it. The recipts look
a little different one of the masters write the room name on it the other
write Shards of Numenor.

All masters have KEYWORD man and they all have a ring. Sorcerer and cleric
master sometimes walk in and out of rooms where trollmobs are, invis does not
help. Thief master passes alot of aggressive mobs when he is east of 
Rivendell. Ranger master uses a longspear and a raccoon fur hat, not a brown
robe. He also has keyword brown.

F- CLASSES
G- USE OF SPELLS
H- SPELLS AND LIMITS
I- HISTORY

F- CLASSES ----------
Dont play a BN who dont have wisdom enough to practice BOB, wis 13
newbiestat as MU, wis 12 newbiestat as thief or warrior. A MU can
practice bob at level 12, a warrior at level 15 and a thief at level
20. 

Dont play a cleric who cant fireball, int 19 as newbie if you dont
have extremly good stats. If you as cleric want two offensive spells
and store you will not afford dodge, track and sneak.

A magicuser need wis 16 newbie for sanct. I dont have it. You can
live without it but its very nice to have not only when pkilling. 
Some supermobs need a sancted buffer. 

G- USE OF SPELLS ----------
First spells to learn are invisibility, create food, create light and
armour. Later you decay what you dont need. 

When you learned about backfire and DEPRESSION you might think its a
good idea to learn 5-15 mana spells to at least 31% and 20-100 mana spells
to at least 51%. You get depressed when you die and when you backfire. Your
maxmana is lowered and your wilpower. Type 'help backfire'.

TELEPORT only works in evil zone and in the zones where Saurons darkness
prevail. Type 'map darkness' and you see darkness and evil zones, '-' on map.

SUMMON is nice to have to 71% and summon a horse or a fellow BN who just
have prayed. Its alot of fun to summon and kill/charm warhorses.

DARKNESS can really save other player, tport to a troll out in nowhere just
before day, cast darkness at a trap if orcs/trolls are around. This spell is
very hard to afford to prac though.

You can only learn CURE SERIOUS to about 55%. You will backfire alot.

When you TELEPORT you make the one who tracks you lose the track. 

PORTAL is extremly handy if you support a group.

*** Return: continue, b: back one page, r: redisplay, q:quit (46%) *** [0;35m[0m

If you dont like when whities use CALL LIGHTNING then learn it yourself.
They will start to spam 'better weather'.

H- SPELLS AND LIMITS ----------
This changes all the time.

Cleric master do NOT teach:
heal, harm, hold, break door, fear, black breath, word of recall, cure light,
detect evil, bless, protection from evil, curse, divination, dispel evil, 
transfer, raise dead.

MU master do NOT teach:
colour spray, silence, find the path, control weather (orc can practice
control weather and we can practice call lightning).

Max % on some spells:
bob 91, sanct 91, blid 97, summon 77, cure serious 56 (my cleric).
enchant 80, charm 80, id/store/offensive damage spells 102.

H- HISTORY ----------
We had permanent nightvision, 200+ mp and we could buy food at Bree grocer.
Despite this life sucked real hard as no legend. We was hunted down like
dogs with old locate life, find the path and teleport with no jetlag. Later
we could do about the same except for ftp. Many newbies got stuck s.w. of
Bree when they prayd to Path around a hill. Butcher corpse was not 
implemeted. Return after crash was not Hidden Island but your last save. Alot
of levels was lost because of unlucky saves.

The orc cave that time at Abandonded Tower was not a good xp area. BNs had
to follow an orc and drop link to get inside, not considered as abuse. The
Golden days to xp was when orc cave northeast of Rivendell was opened. You 
had to learn that cave trolls and demon wolfs are citizens there and where
the orc assassin wanders. Blasted Furnace accepted receipts from BNs and
troll players, orc mended and gave us receipt. But life should not be to 
easy so now we are not welcome there any more.

Hardened rangers was created to whack those of us who picked on low and
midlevels on Road to Fornost down to Tharbad.

The very first orc cave, before we was created, was at Nen-in-sul. To hear
a narrate 'elf at old orc cave' is rather confusing, Nen-in-sul cave/AT cave/
orc cave east of Rivendell (built before Rehorn Cave)/Redhorn Cave (can be
considered as a moved AT cave), which one is it?

Good luck!

Message [32m2781[0m : Gondolin's BN newbie tips ([32m*Lost*[0m)
Written on Tue Jan 12 05:55:04 1999

With MUME VII not coming until some indefinite time in the future, I've
decided to write up some information in addition to Spined's material to help
players start out playing Black Numenoreans. Most of this is just recommend-
ations, and not The Way to Level BNS, but hopefully it will help ease some of
the frustration experienced by players just starting out with the bn race. I've
avoided giving away secret eq loading places, actual directions, secret exits,
and the like. Most of this is advice I give to newbie bns all the time anyways.
In any event, I think most of it should still apply when MUME 7 does come.


Gondolin's BN newbie tips

Spamming:

The most important thing to learn for leveling newbie bns is spam directions.
For some places, just making a map is fine, but there are certain places that
you will need to run very fast through, because of the presence of aggressive,
tracking mobs. You should memorise the directions for these routes. Here are
the main ones, in order of importance, with some of the mobs that you need to
look out for:

1) down Ancient Broken Road (abr) to Khuzur - ferocious wargs, assassin,
   boars (+ trolls if you type the wrong directions)
2) Khuzur to beaver pond area in Eregion - huge wargs, ravens, oxen
3) ford area to Dark Tower (dt) - elven hunters, a few wargs and rabid wolves
4) anywhere on Old East Road (oer) to to ford area - lots of pukes, a few
   wargs and rabid wolves
5) ford area to new orc caves (noc) and dt to noc - elven hunters, wargs, hill
   giants

You should also learn the entire forest area east of rivendell where grey-
cloaked man sometimes loads, so that you can find him and practise before
getting hit by one of the mobs (wargs and black bears) there.

You may want to have sneak turned on when you're walking around, even if you
haven't practised it. Mobs and pukes can still miss you sometimes if you're
fast.

Statting: These are the steps I follow when statting newbie bns.

Step 1 - Practising and travel points
- Bring one torch and maybe a loaf of bread when you pray.
- Look for grey-cloaked man (gcm). When you find him, use all your pracs on

*** Return: continue, b: back one page, r: redisplay, q:quit (45%) *** [0;35m[0m
  dodge, no matter which of the four classes you are.
- Proceed to look for travel points, enough for level 5. Don't start exping
  yet, just look for tps until you get them or die.
- When you get enough tps for level 5, suicide on a mob or puke, then proceed
  to Step 2.

Step 2 - Experience
- Bring a belt, a lantern, and a butcher knife (all essential) and a shield, a
  dagger, bread/biscuits, and cups (not as important).
- Get some real eq (i.e. a sword or something, dodge or absorb eq, and a better
  shield if possible) to make your exping faster. Exping with crypt eq is
  painfully slow.
- Some of the obvious places for basic eq are dt, Khuzur, and Redhorn caves,
  and any corpses you may happen to find, but there are other places (where you
  don't have to kill anything).
- Go kill mobs.
- Best areas for exping are in Eregion, where there are places with no
  aggressive mobs of any consequence and lots of deer, foxes, birds, etc.
  However, there are places in the north that are good for at least a couple
  levels if you want to stay up there.

Step 3 - When you get to level 2 or 3
- If you are near gcm, go max dodge. If you have pracs leftover, get some
  sneak.
- If you are near ranger guild master ('A Man'), practise ride and find a
  mount. Don't bother if he doesn't load near beaver pond, unless you're very
  confident of your knowledge of the area just south and west of Khuzur.
- Continue exping until you're level 5.
- If you die, you won't lose much experience, so get some more eq and start
  again.


On the bow that loads in the crypt: I've found it to be almost completely
useless. The arrows break as often as not, and it's just a waste of time
running around looking for more, or asking orcs for some (while you're still a
newbie).


On having a friend stat you: This is not something that is normally done, so
don't bother other by people asking them if they can help you level. But if you
do have a good friend who is willing to spend time helping you, or someone asks
you if you want help, then by all means take advantage of the opportunity.
Some players who know what they're doing can help a friend stat in as little
as two or three minutes, if he already has his tps.



*** Return: continue, b: back one page, r: redisplay, q:quit (91%) *** [0;35m[0m
Higher levels: Once you stat, get invisibility as soon as possible. Everything
else is up to your discretion. However, sneak + missile (+ blind when you can
get it) can speed up exping a good bit. It's not uncommon for bns to go to noc
and ask orcs to buy them an orkish shortbow and war arrows, though it's by no
means required of them (the orcs). At even higher levels, charm + command is
also very useful.

Written on Tue Feb 20 22:11:29 2001

Cant stand it... every day same room, same steward, same windows...
Been imprisoned here for a long time and gods won't let me out...
No idea why, i'm harmless creature, just want to feel the fresh
wind on my face once again, listen birds singing and walk happily
under the warm sun in vaste Eregion... but gods won't end my 
imprisonment here, even tho i told them that i'm tired of war, 
I just want to return to Umbar to my parents whom I haven't visited
in many-many long years while I was fighting with the enemies of my
Master... aye, once I was a great sorcerer, i could magically trans-
port many minions of the Dark lord to many different parts of Arda, 
I threw mighty fireballs at my enemies and laughed, seeing them
suffer, before delivering the last blow, aye, those are the happy
memories... I was feared during the night, many cowardly slaves hid
behind their city walls when the darkness covered the land and stayed
there, until the Sun once again shined over the forests of Fornost...
Aye, then they came out in hoards but i had already left and only
few bodies of the slaves of Eru marked my bloody path... Oh, those
were the happy days... but the success I had made me proud and my
Master turned away his face from me and luck left me and i hid in 
darkness for sone time... once again i tried to reclaim my former 
place and insert mortal fear in the hearts of my enemies...
I failed...
My Master didn't want me to serve him any more, he had more useful
warriors, he didn't need me... i begged for mercy but his orcish
guards threw me out of Barad-Dur and i left, ashamed...
Many days did I wander alone, even the Sun seemed to darken...
The strength of my Master was slowly growing, he was making the last
preparations before launching massive attack agains the West...
I heard about that on my journeys and my heart was sad, for he had
forgotten me, even tho I had been fine leader for his minions...
The Shadow of my Master was growing... I didn't care any more...
I had been caught by some Elves and Men while i was travelling 
near the city of Tharbad, seeking a place to stay for a night...
They captured my soul, I was not able to do anything and using
magic far darker than I had seen in my darkest dreams and calling
to the might of Manwe, they imprisoned me forever as they hoped...
Hah... little did they know about the strength my seemingly fragile 
body held inside...
I only need time to gather my strength and break the chains that 
keep me imprisoned here in this cursed place... this day is getting
closer and closer, I can feel it...
Yesterday I saw a Fell Beast flying over my head and i called it...
He saw me and came to me to deliver me the message from my Master...

*** Return: continue, b: back one page, r: redisplay, q:quit (89%) *** [0;35m[0m
Finally! The Dark Lord has not forgotten me! He wants me to break
free and return once again to Mordor to recieve my orders...
HAH! Just a few more days and I shall be back, stronger than ever, 
and my enemies will once again feel my wrath, when i burn their 
steaming corpses... and they shall die in pain!

 For the Glory of Numenor!

Written on Thu Apr 26 17:56:05 2001

Winter again. As I sat in a small hut near Tharbad I felt 
the cold wind chilling my bones, even despite the small 
fire I had lit in the middle of a hut. Winter. A dark sad 
season for me... 

I heard news of orcs and trolls gathering to pillage the 
last fortresses of the West... If I was younger I would 
have joined them myself... there were the times when I
rejoiced among the trolls when darkness and snow covered 
the land but that was long time ago... I'm not young any 
more, I'm older than most other generals of Sauron... 

I feel that it might be the time to retire... I have achieved
high status among the armies of the Dark Lord, I was 
one of his greatest warlords, sun darkened and elves fled 
in fear when they heard my name... I've fought for Sauron 
for many-many years but just now I've beginning to under-
stand why this fight between the West and the East has
taken so long... We will never win... Never...

It's sad but true... West is stronger, far stronger than 
Sauron thinks, I know that now... And I think it's finally 
time to leave the battle... I spoke with one the Ring-
wraiths today, he delivered the message from the Dark
Lord himself - 'You may retire my trusted servant,' he
says, 'but don't forget, that perhaps one day I will need
your services once again.' 

Tomorrow I will start my journey towards Umbar... I've
been away from there for a long time, far too long
I really do want to see the yellow sand and sunny beaches
again, walk in forests without the fear of getting ambushe...

But first, i need to bury this damn elf's corpse, otherwise
I can't sleep at all tonight... Elf corpses stink more
than ill trolls... 

 -Prist

Take care my loved ones, I will miss you, honestly :)

Written on Fri May 11 10:52:33 2001

I was hoping for a permanent vacation when I left Western areas and went back
to Umbar... I was hoping that I will never see any stinking child of Eru, I was
hoping for a peaceful life from now on after fighting many years...
Sunny and beautiful was the day I once again saw the beaches of Umbar, heard
the many-couloured birds singing happily, saw again the endless blue sea... My 
heart was glad for I felt that I was finally back home... 

I built a small house near the sea, not far from the last city of the true 
Numenoreans, earned my living by fishing and my life was peaceful and happy... 
I even found the love of my life, beautiful Eharil and we married... She did 
not know who I had been and I never told her...never did I think of Sauron or 
the Great War that still raged furiously, nor did I miss the western lands...

One day I we went off to sea as usually even tho Eharil told me not to...
Dark clouds were seen far away but I've never been afraid of nature... 
She was standing on the beach until I could not see her any more, waving to me, 
her hair flowing in the wind... It was the last time I saw her alive....
The storm caught me before I could check my fishnets and forced me to land on a
small island where I sat by a small fire and listened the wind howling... far 
away a faint light was seen, the great lighthouse of Umbar... 

Next day I set sail towards Umbar. It wasn't far away but the wind was still 
Strong and it took me several hours to reach it... the first thing I saw was 
smoke,  black columns of smoke rising from the great city... And ships, large 
warships of the Western people, many of them, all anchored in the port of 
Umbar... I anchored my boat nearby and sneaked to the city walls... 
I heard screams and sounds of weapons... Screams... Screams of my friends and 
relatives, screams of women and children...
Using my magic I saw hordes of Men and Elves pillaging the city, looting the 
dead, burning the houses and hanging bodies to the branches of trees...
I knew there was nothing to do and I decided to hurry back home to get Eharil 
somewhere safe...

Not far from my house I found tracks... tracks of a Man and an Elf and a Dwarf, 
leading straight towards my home... fear froze my heart and I hurried even 
more... Alas! I was too late...

Where my home used to be there was just a pile of ash, black smoke still 
rising towards the sun... the body of Eharil was chopped to pieces, lying in 
a pool of blood in what used to be a garden filled with flowers... 
Her hand was still helding my old sword of which blade was covered with blood, 
and signs of fierce battle were found everywhere... not far from her i found 
a corpse of an Elf, body covered with wounds...

*** Return: continue, b: back one page, r: redisplay, q:quit (76%) *** [0;35m[0m
Kissing Eharils cold and dead lips I swore to avenge her death...

I tracked down the surviving two raiders and found them nearby... they were 
sitting around a small fire, cooking food and laughing... great was their 
surprise when they saw me and drew their weapons... 
I took my time and killed them slowly, laughing, enjoying every second of it... 
Revenge was sweet, even tho I knew that it will not bring my loved Eharil 
back...

The fleet is leaving Umbar and so am I... the journey back to the Western 
lands will be a long and hazardous one but I don't care... I feel myself 
young again, I need revenge... no Elf nor Dwarf nor Man nor Hobbit will be 
protected from my wrath and their blood shall flow until Sauron has conquered 
the Grey Havens and the last screaming Elf on Middle-Earth has drawn his last 
breath... 

 Blood for Sauron!

Message [32m3466[0m : How to stay alive as a bn ([32mPrist[0m)
Written on Tue May 22 19:17:15 2001


It's impossible. All bns die, no matter how good you are, it's a part
of divine plan or something as they say... ohwell... so basically you
have to get used to dying/reequipping or choose another race to play.

Don't whine how underpowered bns are. We aren't underpowered at all.
Other players think that we are tho, that is what makes them careless
and possible to kill... they will often enter after you in traps, 
hoping for an easy kill, and are surprised if they find themselves in
mandos afterwards... that goes only for players that haven't played bns
themselves - clueful 'old' players know exactly the strengths and weak-
nesses of bns, therefore losing the element of surprise and leading 
(probably) to your own death... it is advisable that you stay away of
such players, unless you are extremely good yourself or have some 
excellent plan you want to try out...

Mostly there are 2 sorts of bns: portalwhores and solohunters. Which
one you want to be is up to you... Portalling bns tend to spend half
of their playing time in Cave, locating mounts and players, preparing
traps etc... such players are hated by the opposite races, called trap-
whores, overkillers etc, on the other hand playertrolls will love you
for you can provide them with a lot of action... it is quite dangerous
tho for after locate/portal you rarely have enough mana to cure yourself
or rearmour or port out or anything like that if things go ugly, probably
resulting in your death... there are a few hints though you can follow
to make your life easier and safer:
1) Use a lot of caps to get ppl for portalling, it works better
2) Don't scout portal - let some orc scout it, otherwise you might end
 up buffing 10+ in closed room and instadying.
3) Do not stand still or try to do damage to pukes. Your only purpose
 is to group orcs/trolls and get them to trap, they do not expect you
 to spam around and nuke... just _try_ to stay alive (it's hard enough
 and keeps you occupied)
4) Get another bn with block with you. You won't have mana to block
 exits when needed, therefore the trap will fail.
5) Do NOT buff any pukes - you got other groupmembers for that.
6) When things go bad, try to regen enough mana and portal your group
 out to safety. Do not port unless you are really dying - you should
 not abandon your group. The worst kind of ppl are those that portal
 several trolls in closable area, then proting somewhere else and
 leaving trolls behind suntrapped, therefore getting them killed.
7) Stay alive.


*** Return: continue, b: back one page, r: redisplay, q:quit (70%) *** [0;35m[0m
The life of a solohunter is much more interesting and dangerous tho.
Your main hunting ground will be Morthan/eregion/abr horseshoe, last
changes to powerrangers have made it almost impossible for bns to solo-
hunt near bree/fnost so there is no point in going there to kill lvl 3
sleeping *elves*, therefore u should carefully learn the southern areas...
Tharbad is OUR city and it is your holy duty to slay every puke who is
careless or stupid enough to visit it. But don't get too excited tho - 
sometimes you meet unnamed legends there who can annihilate your sorry
ass back to the Island...
As usually there are some hints to help you when you try to hunt solo:
1) Try to avoid powerrangers.
2) Kill all pukes you meet.
3) Stay alive.

Simple, isn't it? This whole post is 100% useless though, written only
because it is awfully boring to wait for some friendly V+ that would
let me out of retirement for the 348275482th time... but if you had
enough time and patience to read it then perhaps my time wasn't completely
wasted either :)

Take care my little ones!

Written on Sun Mar  3 23:00:41 2002

Days grow longer and nights shorter... soon it's summer again, hot, long summer
of Middle-Earth... but still i'm resting in my small hut near the great city of
Tharbad and it's cold, horribly cold, even despite a small campfire that is lit
in my room... no fire can warm my bones, no sunshine makes me happy. I'm getting

old... I'm already older than most of the great race of Numenoreans, i'm old and

I feel my death nearing me... I do not fear the death, but i'm afraid our
mission 
will not be complete once i'm gone...

It was a fair world when i was a child, playing happily on the shore of the
Great 
Sea, I remember how beautiful was the city of Umbar long ago... I remember
watching 
suntset from the roof of our small house with Eharil, I remember waiting my
father 
back from the sea and the smile on his tired face when he finally returned in
his 
small boat... it was a beautiful world when I was young, and this world only
lives 
now in my memories... it was so long ago... and how I wish I had never left
Umbar
in my search for adventures...

I remember the day I started my journey, with some trusty friends, armed with 
shortbows and longswords, laughing and joking for the world seemed friendly and 
kind... but with each travelling day the shadow grew in our minds and our small 
party scattered... Thler got killed and Alor badly injured by a wild lion who 
charged our night camp, Foren went hunting one day and never returned... My last

companion, Bader, was gone one morning when i woke up and I do not know to this 
day, what happened to him... 

I continued my journey alone through dreadful landscape, exhausted, hungry, 
thirsty... I was chased by beasts and the enemies of the great Numenorean race- 
elves and dwarves... They teached me what the word 'hate' means, and i swore to 
repay them for all I had suffered...

It was a cold and chilly day when I travelled in area nowadays known as Eregion 
when I saw a camplight... I sneaked towards it and found a strange man, all 
dressed in black, sitting there... he saw my coming and when I prepared to run 
or fight until death, he smiled at me and greeted me in our own ancient
language... 
He said that his name is Misery and that he has just returned from a journey to 
Tharbad... seeing that I was new to those dreadful lands, he offered me his help

and for many days we travelled together... I learnt a lot and I met several of 
our kinsman, walking around those lands... I learnt that our numbers were many 
and even more were coming from far south... 

Misery didn't like the thought of leaving Eregion, but I desired to see wide 
lands in the North, so one daywhen i felt I was ready, we left our separate 
ways... I met orcs and trolls far north and had many friends among them, we 
often travelled together, me with my good friends Swhat and Zerg... I was a 

*** Return: continue, b: back one page, r: redisplay, q:quit (40%) *** [0;35m[0m
fast learner and I will never forget the day I first saw Tharbad... Oh, the 
great walls and shops and people from faraway countries, thieves and assassins 
and great mages and priests... I remember a day when 3-4 of us, Black
Numenoreans 
as our enemies call us, were sitting in an inn, drinking beer and resting from 
our journeys, when a hobbit stepped in and seeing us, tried to flee in panic...
he didn't run far tho, we followed him fast and our leader, Soron, was kind 
enough to slay him with his own hand and thus ended the life of Smooth the
Hobbit... 

All of this was long ago, so long ago... there's no more joy in my heart, I slay

my enemies without any pity, yet it brings me no happiness any more... The Dark 
Lord's armies are weakening, orctribes are fighting among themselves and against

us, once great hordes of Black Numenoreans are no more... there remain only a
few 
of those that were here when I reached those lands, there are even less of those

who were here before me... they are legends, we speak of their great dees when
we 
meet, yet those meetings are rare nowadays... Often have I thought, will the
younger 
ones speak stories of me when i'm gone? Will anyone remember me at all?  Will
there
ever be as great horde of us as there once was? 

A few days ago I returned from a long yourney to the East. I visited many weird 
countries, saw many strange animals... I saw calm brown waters of the Sea of
Nurnen 
and I watchedMumaks fighting among themselves on the great plains of Harad... I
saw 
people with yellow skin and red tongue, I met creatures that have dwelled in the

deep caves since the Beginning. It is a strange world, yet, nowhere did I find
rest 
nor peace... all of those creatures i met, they still have home, their campfire
they 
return to... while we, the last great race of Men do not have anything... we're 
renegades, hated by many and loved by none, we kill to live and we kill, because

that's the only thing we're good at... we're among the greatest of mages ever
walked 
on Middle-Earth, we're feared and despised, we are called legends if we're
successful 
and we will die if we're not... I want back those times back, times, when all
whitepukes 
were sitting in their fortified cities when sun went down because leaving those
walls 
meant death... the world has changed while i have not... I'm still the same, old
and 
grim, despised among my enemies, and I will not change... 

Yet, all of this fighting leads us nowhere...
It does not matter how famous you are or how great you are, ultimately your
bones 
will lie under the burning sun and decay, we die in wastelands and our names
will 
fade into history of the War of the Ring... our race is dying and legends will
be 
forgotten... There is no hope for us and our future looks darker than the
night... 
we can never return to our homes for they do not exist anymore... we have no
place 
to go, no hope, nothing...

I'm cold, and the fire is burning low... I draw my blankets closer to my skin
and 
shiver... Wind is howling outside, cold, biting wind that sounds like a tortured

animal... Nothing is as it once was, all that was once strong, is now weak... 

I want to see the Great Sea again, run in blue waters and watch silvery fish
nimbly

swimming around my feet... I want to feel the warmth of sun once again on my
face, 
sit on top of the walls of Umbar and watch the huge black sails of our
warships... 
memories, only memories are what is left of my childhood world... Memories... 

It is dark.. all is dark and i cannot see... I don't even know if my eyes are
closed 
or open and it doesn't matter... will there ever be anyoneto remember me? Does
our 
great race of Men have any hope or do we diminish and become just another page
in the 
history of Arda? Too many questions and no answers at all... the Sea, the great
blue 
sea... Oh how I desire to look upon it once again before I die and face whatever

happens with me after death...

I better get some sleep... night is almost over and a fellow Numenorean told me 
that there are some elves heading towards Tharbad and they should be there
soon... 
of course, once in, they will never leave... i'm still pretty good at killing
elves...

Message [32m4181[0m : An ancient diary ([32mVardamir[0m)
Written on Sat Nov 10 19:53:07 2007


It appears to be an ancient diary written by Vardamir Nólimon.
It's a book of leather with pages made of what seems like human skin.
The words are blood-stained and at places you notice tiny nails attached
in the dry skin. You're questioning the very movements of your eyes
as you open the book and begin to scroll down...

'...Nólimon, a name meaning 'most learned'. Given as a surname to me
by Elros, my father, because of my former great love of ancient lore
and knowledge, which I collected from many sources. As the eldest
of Elros' four children, the Sceptre of Númenor fell to me on
my father's death. The extraordinary length of his life meant that
I was 381 years old at that time - old even for a Númenórean of royal blood
- so I passed the Sceptre on immediately to the eldest of my own
children, who became King Tar-Amandil.

This is what Amandil told me they were going to write in the history books.
Sometimes when the nights are quiet I can still feel that grin on his face
behind my back, sending me shivers down my spine. I am the Uncrowned
King of Númenor, and years have passed since they put me on this Island.
I only managed to get a slight grasp of the Sceptre before the guards came
and broke down the door. There was nothing I could do - Amandil had planned the
betrayal for a long time and paid his informers well. He knew exactly when
to ambush - the night before the ceremony when the Sceptre was delivered.
This is the truth and I hope you, whoever finds this, will avenge me...'

looking close you're still able to read most of it...

' The foreign tongue grows stronger within me now. I can not sleep.
I haven't eaten for days and there's no more weed to ease my pain.
The eye stares at me, and I see him even though he took my eyes away.
It's so cold. The black cape surrounding me seem to annihilate the
very colour of my skin. I fear what he will do to me. I fear what
I am about to become. A beast has been flying in circles above me for
days now. The past minute he's been approaching but I don't have the
strength to flee. This will be my last entry...

...Ohh Sauron, my Lord...'

Message [32m4198[0m : The insolence of the false gods! ([32m*Lost*[0m)
Written on Fri Aug  6 17:33:41 2010

pray False gods! I demand you grant me basic equipment for penance of the
wrongs you inflicted on mighty Númenór!
You send your prayer to the Ainur.
Someone smiles upon you as you receive some basic equipment.
The Ainulindalë whispers to you 'But you only get it because we find it
entertaining how you will lose even this. This is not a gift of mercy, the
unavoidable loss will only increase your suffering!'
pray I spit upon you! May Melkor and Sauron rise and smite you!
You send your prayer to the Ainur.
The Ainulindalë whispers to you 'We are not concerned about an ant's wrath!'

Message [32m4203[0m : Gear here now, but gone tomorrow! WARNING! ([32mKimono[0m)
Written on Tue Mar  1 17:50:53 2011

The Dark Lord graces us with the ability to camp rent
almost anywhere, but as always there is a price that
we pay. When you climb into your tent for rest, keep
in mind that we have no innkeeper to pay our dues. We
handle our own storage of precious gear and have no
way to pay an innkeeper to recover lost gear. Do not
go handing gold to any of the guild masters we look
up to, or anyone else in your travels for there is
no one to return our gear to us.

Message [32m4204[0m : Stables of the East ([32mKimono[0m)
Written on Tue Mar  1 18:00:24 2011

Come on folks! Why are stables being replenished by
only the Numenorean Rangers?! It is simple: If you
are near Brolg and find any abandoned mounts, lead
them inside where another fellow Numenorean may
need and use it in the future. If you are near the
Orc caves, bring them into Slag pit and house them
deep within where the wretched scums of the west
wont steal them. You get my point, the same applies
with Warrens, Ohurk, the Dark Tower and so on. The
Numenorean Rangers are working very hard to keep
the homeless mounts fed and housed so we can all
benefit from having them nearby at a moments notice,
so please help if you pass one! They need a home
too.
