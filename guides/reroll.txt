When you reroll your character, its new stats have to be close to its old stats.
As I write those lines (February 2013), all the stats generators available
online compute the new/old difference incorrectly. I logged an old retired
character, tried to reroll it. The following table shows the actual difference.

Difference in stats	Distance
-------------------	--------
0			0
1			14
2			33
3			56
4			80
5			106

Remember: the distance between old and new stats should not be above 100.
