It looks like the TP requirements for the traveller quest are about 2K per level.

Here is a list of characters who got the quest given to them:
- Aftereight : 32,578 TPS / 15 LVL
- Zid : 42,387 TPS / 20 LVL

And a list of characters who did not get the quest given:
- Zid: 43,890 TPS / 21 LVL

I was given the following advice about the ice demon area:

Someone says 'and third... just before you go in, there's avalanche'
Someone says 'so alias "open crease"'
Someone says 'or pretype'
Someone says 'have someone to shroud you in Rivendell'
Someone says 'also, once you've triggered avalanche, don't go up the slope'
Someone says 'you can go n into crease'
Someone says 'or run d and s from crease'
Someone says 'but don't go like d and up'
Someone says 'that will instantly kill you'
