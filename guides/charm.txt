Guide To Charmies (initially by Scad)
=====================================

Those are listed from best to worse in each category. This list is not exhaustive, indeed.

- Charmies that can rescue (And protect): Dark Wraith, Powerful Lioness, Grey Skinned Mountain Troll, Thief.
- Charmies that buff well: Grey Skinned Mountain Troll, Mother Eagle, Orkish Shaman, Wraiths.
- Charmies that have good moves: Mother eagle, Malevolent bats, Orkish Shaman.
- Charmies that can bash: Grey Skinned Mountain Troll, Lion, Boar.
- Charmies with high strength (Closing/opening delayed doors): Mule, Pack Horse, Mountain Troll.
- Special Charmies: Orkish Shaman (will cast randomly blind, harm, poison, magic missile, burning hands). Tarantula (Arachnia)
- Charmies that can climb: Mother eagle, Tarantula.
- Charmies that can sneak and hide: Wraith, Thieves, maybe Lioness.
- Charmies that don't leave tracks: all spirit-kind charmies, Mother Eagle.

The powerful lionesses found east of Tharbad, and North of Broggha can bash on command, they also can rescue, protect, sneak, and hide, they have decent moves, not near a mother eagles but still worth it. Also it is extremely easy to charm two of them!

Wraiths have very poor moves.


Some special notes 
------------------

Trolls will sun, just like normal trolls so be careful with them.

Orkish shaman is only found in moria, so its kind of tough to get, but if your going to be using charmie in group it is very good since its not aggressive. Just make sure no one hits 'orc' when he is 1.orc in room, or he will be aggressive to them.

Wraiths are found all over the place, they are not really awesome tanks... but they are easy to find, and more importantly they are relatively easy to charm two, and 2 wraiths are better for buffing than a single any other charmie.

Charming two mountain trolls is possible, but much more difficult. Its best to sleep the 2nd one before attempting to charm it, because sleeping makes it ineff vs charm (Sleep is ineff vs all mental spells, charm, sleep, blind, maybe magic blast and black breath too). Anyway, two mountain trolls can tank damn near anything and they bash to boot, so its quite worth it if your soloing smobs in moria or some such.

When xp'ing with charmies, you get slightly less xp than if you solo'd the mob, but it doesn't affect your trophy in a bad way, and you can kill things considerably faster/using less mana and hp, so its still quite effective.

You can charm a mob even if it can't see you (i.e. if you're shrouded, or if it's blind).

After exping for 1 hour with your charmie, it's best to let it sleep and recharm it. It's better than letting the charm break. Also, you can let your charmie sleep somewhere safe, wait for the spell to wear out, then go pick up another mob, charm it, and come back to the sleeping mob. This can help you to charm two strong mobs.

Raised shadows are charmable. Yes, that means ANYONE can have a cute little Great Goblin shadow that hits like Melkor himself. Unfortunately, these shadows have to be abandoned by their masters. If you see one laying around in DT or so, don't hesitate to charm. They are tough to command, but thats what maxxing the skill is for! :)
